# Adaptive Weighting Landmark-based Group-wise Registration On Lung DCE-MRI Images
To make readers better understanding our paper, we will release our Matlab code and some expamle results in the next few months.

[new] the multiscale local rigid matching is released.

[notification] Some functions in FAIR has been modified (e.g. the NGF function).
